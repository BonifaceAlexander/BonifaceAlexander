Boniface Alexander — AI Engineer | LLM Systems | Agentic Automation | GenAI Architect

I design and build production-grade GenAI systems, with a strong focus on LLM-based agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, autonomous workflows, and vision-based AI solutions.
My work spans industry-scale automation, data-intensive pipelines, model optimization, and developer tooling for AI ecosystems.

I contribute actively to open-source, publish technical content, and collaborate on initiatives that advance trustworthy, efficient, and scalable GenAI systems.
My long-term goal is to build globally deployable agentic infrastructures that power automation, enterprise intelligence, and scientific computing.

🚀 Current Focus Areas

Agentic AI Architectures: Multi-agent pipelines, memory systems, tool-augmented agents, LLM-driven automation

Advanced RAG Systems: Evaluation frameworks, scalable retrieval strategies, hybrid search, observability

LLM Infrastructure: Prompt engineering, cost-efficient inference, LangChain & Gemini ecosystems, Python backends

Computer Vision & GenAI: Image editing, image generation, model reasoning improvements

Developer Tools: Packages, dashboards, and workflows for AI reliability, evaluation, interpretability, and performance

🧠 Key Projects & Open-Source Work
🟣 VisionPrime — AI Image Studio (Gemini + GenAI SDK)

A fully fledged image creation, enhancement, and editing suite designed for creators, built using Google’s Gemini models.
